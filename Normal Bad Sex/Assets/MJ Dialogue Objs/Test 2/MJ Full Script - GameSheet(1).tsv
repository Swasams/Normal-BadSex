Because I was pretty, they didn't expect much of me. I was told by the guidance counselor, Sister Agnes- you're not going to get into college. You're not going to get into art school. You should probably be a secretary and get married to that hunk you're going out with. 	10_Nuns2	Nun			TRUE

What was happening with my husband at the time, was that he couldn't get his act together as a filmmaker,	40_Marriage3	40Divorce			TRUE
and so, uh, his dick didn't exactly go down, but my career went up, and our sexual relationship went down.	40_Marriage4	40Divorce			FALSE
 I was intimidating to him, and he became boring to me. 	40_Marriage5	40Divorce			TRUE
I wanted the thing to work, but I was only willing to give it like, four years, and two of which were pretty bad. So I left.	40_Marriage6	40Divorce			TRUE
I got a divorce.  it still was a little sad.  It didn't affect how I felt about myself, because I felt powerful in the world	40_Marriage7	40Divorce			FALSE

At 50, I was in a very good place, actually.  But it was in the mid 50s when I started to deal with vaginal dryness, 	50_Gyno1	50Gyno			TRUE
and it's awful when it happens. I was not having much sex because it hurt.	50_Gyno2	50Gyno			TRUE
